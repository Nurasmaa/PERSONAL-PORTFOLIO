<p title="My Feature"> I will let you know about myself in this writing. I am :    </p>

<l>
	<li>Friendly</li>
	<li> Trying hard</li>
	<li> Appreciate time</li>
</l>

<p title="Friendly">First, i am a friendly person because if i go anywhere i can make new friend at that place immediately. For example, if i go to cooking class, at the first day i will talk <br> without any  shame with another person in that class. I will talk to them like i have know them for a long time. I really like to have many friends because with friends,<br>  my life will happy and i will get to know about another person attitude.  </p>

<p title="Trying hard">The second feature about myself is i am trying hard person. Why i am saying this because if i what something i must get it such as i want to have new handbag so i will <br> save my money to get the handbag. Another example is when i am missed in my study, i will learn again until i understand the matter. I am not satisfied until i get what <br> i need. I am grateful that i have this feature in myself because it make me excited everyday.  </p>

<p title="Appreciate Time"> Lastly, i am the person that really appreciate time. Time is like gold because if you miss that time, whatever you do you cannot bring that time again. I really dont like a <br> person that cannot appreciate time for example when that person promise with me to go out, and they cannot keep their promise to come at the time. When i promise with <br> someone to see out there, i will come at the promise time. I also always go to class before the lecturer come because if i am late, i miss my study. </p>
